# Game Base for Unity

This is a collection of utilities, scripts, prefabs and scenes that I reuse for my game jams when working with Unity.

## What is included

- AudioSystem: a feature-packed audio system that you can use to play music and sound effects with its own editor.
- PowerSprite: an advanced 2D sprite and animation system from Powerhoof. It lets you import sprites and animations from Aseprite and it makes super easy to work with them.

## TODO
